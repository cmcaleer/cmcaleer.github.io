            Hesperos is an innovative biotechnology company specializing in pre-clinical testing of novel therapeutic compounds for efficacy and toxicity. Utilizing functional human based multi-organ tissue systems it is possible to measure loss of organ functionality long before endpoint death analysis of traditional in vitro monitoring assays. Familiarity of an array of organ cell types including, but not limited to, neurons, skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, NMJ, kidney, hepatocytes, BBB, cancer, and bone marrow. 
            I run a small team of scientists as a for charge service to investigate efficacy/toxicity and predict functional loss of novel therapeutic compounds.
